> ### ExpressJS + React + Redux-Toolkit + RTK Query codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with ExpressJS + React + Redux-Toolkit + RTK Query including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

## Frontend

TBC

## Backend

**ExpressJS** - I decided to go with express because it's what I've always used to build backends when I needed to. My other choice was to go with Golang since I've been learning it on and off for some time and this seemed like the perfect chance to use it and learn. Ultimately I decided to go with express though because I'm also trying to get more comfortable with typescript which has been amazing so far, I'm now beginning to see how powerful it can be.

**Testing** - I made it an absolute priority to write tests for this project since it's always something I say I'll get to but never do. Still trying to learn the best practices but so far it's been pretty pleasant.

**Postgres** - I went with Postgres, again something I'm pretty comfortable with and a database I use when building a backend. Not much else to say here other than it fulfills my needs.

**Prisma** - I honestly don't think I will ever use another ORM ever, seriously. I've been using prisma for a while and seeing what it has become now is amazing. They have a lot of information about how to model your databases and how to write your schemas. Oh also the autocompletion. _chefs kiss_
